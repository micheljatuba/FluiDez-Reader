"""Persistent device-book metadata cache.

Calibre marks a library book as "on device" by matching the device's book list
against the library — primarily by ``uuid`` (which Calibre embeds in every EPUB
it sends), falling back to title+author. The device only stores raw files, so on
reconnect ``books()`` would otherwise have nothing but a filename to offer, and
nothing matches.

This cache remembers, per device, the identity of each file we know about
(``lpath -> {size, uuid, title, authors}``). It is populated when a book is sent
(we have the full ``Metadata`` then) and read back on every connect, so a book
sent from this machine is recognized and marked on-device without re-downloading
it. Entries are keyed by a device id so multiple devices don't collide, and are
pruned when a file is deleted or no longer present on the device.
